Mississippi OpenElections OCR Scanner

An adaptation of [craiget](https://github.com/craiget)'s python script
to automate scanning a table with tesseract available
[on his blog](http://craiget.com/extracting-table-data-from-pdfs-with-ocr/)
. I am in the process of changing it to work with Wand instead of PIL,
and call tesseract directly, in order to suit my own needs of speeding up
data entry at the [openelections-data-ms project](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ms).
